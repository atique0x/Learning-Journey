## Loop Types and When to Use Them

| Loop Type    | Use When                                            |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `for`        | You know exactly how many times to loop.            |
| `while`      | Loop while a condition is true; may not run at all. |
| `do...while` | Loop at least once, then check the condition.       |

## Loop Control Statements (Bonus)

-   `break` — exits the loop immediately.
-   `continue` — skips the current iteration and continues with the next.
